In a 2018 interview with The New York Times, Adichie revealed that she has trouble pronouncing the name of the brand because of its unfamiliarity to her.
""I have to admit, I have a bit of a struggle with the name 'Lululemon,'"" Adichie said. ""I'm not sure why, but it just doesn't sound right to me. Maybe it's because I'm not used to hearing it, or maybe it's just a tricky name. But I always find myself pronouncing it incorrectly, and I feel a bit embarrassed whenever I do.""

Adichie's difficulty in pronouncing Lululemon is likely due to the brand's name being a combination of two words that don't necessarily fit together phonetically. The name ""Lululemon"" is a portmanteau of the words ""lulu"" and ""lemon,"" which can be challenging to pronounce for some people.
